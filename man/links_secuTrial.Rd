\title{Show links between forms}
\usage{
links_secuTrial(object, forms = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{secuTrialdata object}

\item{forms}{a regular expression for which forms should be included}
}
\value{
a tcltk plot window.
}
\description{
SecuTrial creates a large number of files and identifiers with which to link files together. Understanding the links can be difficult. This function produces a map linking the forms with common variables.
}
\details{
We recommend to resize the tcltk window and and click view/"fit to screen" to improve readability. Forms are coloured red, variables are coloured blue.
}
\note{
Note that where a form name is also a variable name, it is appended by \code{_form} (igraph requires uniquely named nodes).
