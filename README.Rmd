# secuTrialR ![travis](https://api.travis-ci.com/SwissClinicalTrialOrganisation/secuTrialR.svg?branch=master)

An R package to handle data from the clinical data management system (CDMS) [secuTrial](https://www.secutrial.com/en/).

## Installing from github with devtools

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("SwissClinicalTrialOrganisation/secuTrialR")
```

## Basic usage
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(secuTrialR)
```

```{r}
# prepare path to example export
export_location <- system.file("extdata", "s_export_CSV-xls_BMD.zip",
                               package = "secuTrialR")
# load all export data
sT_export <- load_secuTrial_export(data_dir = export_location)
```
Printing the object gives some useful information about the objects within the objects, such as the original file name in the datafile, it's name in the `secuTrialdata` object, together with the number of rows and columns and a column indicating whether the object is metadata or not:
```{r}
sT_export
```


For creating tables, it is often useful to have access to variable labels. This is simple in secuTrialR.
```{r}
labs <- labels_secuTrial(sT_export)
# query the list with the variable name of interest
labs[["age"]]

```
### Visit plan
secuTrialR can provide a depiction of the visit structure:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
vs <- visit_structure(sT_export)
plot(vs)
```
<!-- PLOT METHOD DIRECTLY FOR secuTrialdata objects? -->

### Linkage amongst secuTrial forms
Linkages amongst forms can be explored with the `links_secuTrial` function. This relies on the `igraph` package to create a network. The network is plotted using `tikz`, which allows one to interact with the network (e.g. move nodes around in order to read the label better). The device ID is returned to the console, but can be ignored. Forms are plotted in red, variables in blue.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
links_secuTrial(sT_export)

```

## For contributors
### Testing with devtools

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# run tests
devtools::test("secuTrialR")
# spell check -> will contain some R and secuTrial specific words which is fine
devtools::spell_check("secuTrialR")
```

### Linting with lintr

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# lint the package -> should be clean
library(lintr)
lint_package("secuTrialR", linters = with_defaults(camel_case_linter = NULL,
                                                   object_usage_linter = NULL,
                                                   line_length_linter(125)))
```

### Generating the README file

The README file contains both standard text and interpreted R code. It must therefore be compiled. Changes should be made in the README.Rmd file and the file "knited" with R. This is easiest with RStudio, but other methods are available.

### Guidelines for contributers

In order to contribute to this R package you should fork the main repository.
After you have made your changes please run the 
[tests](README.md#testing-with-devtools)
and 
[lint](README.md#linting-with-lintr) your code as 
indicated above. If all tests pass and linting confirms that your 
coding style conforms you can send a pull request (PR).  
The PR should have a description to help the reviewer understand what has been 
added/changed. New functionalities must be thoroughly documented, have examples 
and should be accompanied by at least one [test](tests/testthat/) to ensure longterm 
robustness. The PR will only be reviewed if all travis checks are successful. 
The person sending the PR should not be the one merging it.

A depiction of the core functionalities for loading can be found [here](inst/extdata/secuTrialR.png).
